# crowdflower_search_result_reference

In this project, I am visualising a dataset of a Kaggle competition called [Search Result Relevance](https://www.kaggle.com/c/crowdflower-search-relevance) by **CrowdFlower**. By choosing this dataset, I am hoping to prove the practicality of doing Udacity courses i.e. have we really learned relevant knowledge to real-world data analysis problem? and what is the gap between what we have learned so far to what the industry needs?

The dataset in this project has initially 6 variables, but we will have to preprocess it so we can use it in our analysis. In the end the dataset used in our analysis would contain 8+ variables, thus adhering to this project's requirements.
